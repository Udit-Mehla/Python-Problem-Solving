# Python Problem Solving 🐍

Welcome to my journey of mastering Python through algorithmic challenges! This repository tracks my progress as I solve problems from LeetCode and other platforms.

## 🚀 Goals
* Solve 3 problem every day.
* Improve code efficiency ($O(n)$ time complexity).
* Master Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees).

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `/LeetCode` - Solutions to LeetCode problems.
* `/Basics` - Fundamental Python exercises.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
